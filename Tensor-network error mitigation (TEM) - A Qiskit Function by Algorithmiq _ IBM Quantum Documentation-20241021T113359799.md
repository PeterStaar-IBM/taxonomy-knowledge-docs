## Tensor-network error mitigation (TEM): A Qiskit Function by Algorithmiq

## Note

Qiskit Functions are an experimental feature available only to IBM Quantumâ„¢ Premium Plan users. They are in preview release status and subject to change.

## Overview

Algorithmiq's Tensor-network Error Mitigation (TEM) method is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for performing noise mitigation entirely at the classical post-processing stage. With TEM, the user can compute the expectation values of observables mitigating the inevitable noise-induced errors that occur on quantum hardware with increased accuracy and cost efficiency, making it a highly attractive option for quantum researchers and industry practitioners alike.

The method consists of constructing a tensor network representing the inverse of the global noise channel affecting the state of the quantum processor and then applying the map to informationally complete measurement outcomes acquired from the noisy state to obtain unbiased estimators for the observables.

As an advantage, TEM leverages informationally complete measurements to give access to a vast set of mitigated expectation values of observables and has optimal sampling overhead on the quantum hardware, as described in Filippov at al. (2023), arXiv:2307.11740 , and Filippov at al. (2024), arXiv:2403.13542 . The measurement overhead refers to the number of additional measurements required to perform efficient error mitigation, a critical factor in the feasibility of quantum

computations. Therefore, TEM has the potential to enable quantum advantage in complex scenarios, such as applications in the fields of quantum chaos, many-body physics, Hubbard dynamics, and small molecule chemistry simulations.

The main features and benefits of TEM can be summarized as:

1. Optimal measurement overhead : TEM is optimal with respect to theoretical bounds , meaning that no method can achieve a smaller measurement overhead. In other words, TEM requires the minimum number of additional measurements to perform error mitigation. This in turns means that TEM uses minimal quantum runtime.

2. Cost-effectiveness : Since TEM handles noise mitigation entirely in the post-processing stage, there is no need to add extra circuits to the quantum computer, which not only makes the computation cheaper but also diminishes the risk of introducing additional errors due to the imperfections of quantum devices.

3. Estimation of multiple observables : Thanks to informationallycomplete measurements, TEM efficiently estimates multiple observables with the same measurement data from the quantum computer.

4. Measurement error mitigation : The TEM Qiskit Function also includes a proprietary measurement error mitigation method able to significantly reduce readout errors after a short calibration run.

5. Accuracy : TEM significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of digital quantum simulations, making quantum algorithms more precise and dependable.

## Description

The TEM function allows you to obtain error-mitigated expectation values for multiple observables on a quantum circuit with minimal sampling overhead. The circuit is measured with an informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (IC-POVM), and the collected measurement outcomes are processed on a classical computer. This measurement is used to perform the tensor network methods and build a noise-inversion map. The function applies a map that fully inverts the whole noisy circuit using tensor networks to represent the noisy layers.

Error-mitigated estimation of an observable O via post-processing measurement outcomes of the noisy quantum processor. U and N denote an ideal quantum operation and the associated noise map, which can be generally non-local (and extended to grey boxes). D stands for a tensor of operators that are dual to the effects in the IC measurement. The noise mitigation module M is a tensor network that is efficiently contracted from the middle out. The first iteration of the contraction is represented by the dotted purple line, the second one by the dashed line, and the third one by the solid line.

Once the circuits are submitted to the function, they are transpiled and optimized to minimize the number of layers with two-qubit gates (the noisier gates on quantum devices). The noise affecting the layers is learned through Qiskit Runtime using a sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise model as described in E. van den Berg, Z. Minev, A. Kandala, K. Temme, Nat. Phys. (2023). arXiv:2201.09866 .

The noise model is an accurate description of the noise on the device able to capture subtle features, including qubit cross-talk. However, noise on the devices can fluctuate and drift and the learned noise might not be accurate at the point at which the estimation is done. This might result in inaccurate results.
