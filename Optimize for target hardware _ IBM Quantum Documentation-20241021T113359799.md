## Optimize for target hardware

In the "optimize for target hardware" step of a Qiskit pattern, you take the abstract circuits (or operators) produced from the map step and perform a series of optimizations on them. This can include mapping the route and layout of the circuit to physical qubit hardware, converting to basis gates of the hardware, and reducing the number of operations, all designed to optimize the likelihood of success in the later execute step. At this point you might also wish to debug your circuits with a simulator before executing on real hardware in the next step.

During this step, abstract circuits must be transpiled to Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) circuits. An ISA circuit is one that only consists of gates understood by the target hardware (basis gates), and any multiqubit gates needed to obey any connectivity constraints (coupling map). Only ISA circuits can be run on IBMÂ® hardware using IBM Qiskit Runtime.
