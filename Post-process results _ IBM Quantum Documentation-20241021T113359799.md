## Post-process results

<!-- image -->

This final "post-process results" step of a Qiskit pattern involves stitching the outputs from the prior step back together to obtain the desired result. This can involve a range of classical data-processing steps such as visualizing results, readout error mitigation techniques, marginalizing quasi-probability distributions to ascertain results on smaller sets of qubits, or post-selection on inherent properties of the problem, such as total spin, parity, or particle conservation by removing unphysical observables.
